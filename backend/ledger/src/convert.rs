//! Numeric conversions at the SQLite boundary.
//!
//! SQLite stores every integer as `i64`, but our domain types use unsigned
//! widths: `u64` token counts and `u32` counts/timings. These helpers keep the
//! lossy boundary in exactly one place, with a single documented policy:
//!
//! * **reads** (`i64_to_u64`, `i64_to_u32`) clamp out-of-range values to `0` —
//!   a negative or oversized stored count is corruption, and `0` is the only
//!   sensible interpretation of a non-negative-domain column gone bad;
//! * **writes** (`u64_to_i64`) saturate at `i64::MAX` — a count that large is
//!   already nonsensical, and saturating beats silently wrapping negative;
//! * **cost math** (`u64_to_f64`) widens token counts to `f64`, lossless in
//!   practice because no workload approaches `f64`'s 2^53 exact-integer ceiling.
