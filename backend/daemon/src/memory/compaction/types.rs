/// 1. [`CompactionLlm::build_initial_request`] — produce the first

///    compaction tail.
/// 2. [`CompactionLlm::generate`] — run a single round against an
///    already-built (possibly extended) request.
///
/// `chat_request` carries chat's `(system, tools, messages)` — either pulled
/// from `AutonomyState::last_request` (the warm-cache path) or rebuilt from
/// disk via `handler::build_chat_shape_request_from_disk` (the cold path).
/// Either way the wire shape is identical to what chat's next turn would
/// send. The implementation rebuilds against the compaction model and
/// appends the "compact now" user message plus an inline `role:"system"`
/// entry carrying the compaction instruction at a fixed slot — see
/// `compaction_impls::COMPACTION_TAIL_ENTRY_COUNT` for why this is the only
