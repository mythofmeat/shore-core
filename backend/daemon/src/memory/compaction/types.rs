/// The compaction manager drives the tool loop itself (it owns the path
/// filter, rollback list, and the "no writes → no archive" guard). The LLM
/// trait is therefore split into two small pieces:
///
/// 1. [`CompactionLlm::build_initial_request`] — produce the first
///    `LlmRequest` for a pass, honouring the cached-prefix tail invariant
///    and the per-provider `system_suffix` routing.
/// 2. [`CompactionLlm::generate`] — run a single round against an
///    already-built (possibly extended) request.
///
/// When `cached_request` is `Some`, the implementation MUST reuse it as the
/// cached prefix base — clone it, push the compaction prompts as inline
/// `role:"system"` messages (the Anthropic provider transforms these into
/// `<system_instruction>` user wrappers), and avoid touching the top-level
/// `system` parameter so the conversation's prompt cache prefix stays valid.
///
/// `fresh_tools` are only used when `cached_request` is `None`. In the
/// cached path the cached request's `tools` field is inherited verbatim so
/// the Anthropic cache-prefix hash matches the chat request that seeded
/// the cache.
