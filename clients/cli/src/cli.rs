/// - `reasoning_effort`: pass through as a string. Synonyms for
///   "disable" ("none"/"disable"/"disabled"/"unset"/"") collapse to the
///   sentinel "off"; the daemon's overlay then explicitly suppresses
///   `reasoning_effort` on the resolved model. JSON null is reserved
///   for *clearing* a saved preference (handled by `unset` flows).
/// - `replay_prior_thinking`: tri-state (#191). The strings
///   "all"/"last_turn"/"none" pass through verbatim; the legacy bool words
///   "true"/"yes"/"on" (→ all) and "false"/"no"/"off" (→ none) still coerce to
///   a bool the daemon maps for back-compat.
/// - `temperature`, `top_p`: parse as f64.
/// - `budget_tokens`, `max_output_tokens`, `max_tool_iterations`: parse as
///   integer.
/// - `cache_ttl`, `cache_keepalive`: pass through as a string (the daemon
///   parses `cache_keepalive`'s `off`/duration domain).
